# Bombs and Flowers

This is an HTML-based noughts-and-crosses (tic-tac-toe) program. I originally
wrote it as a classroom demo for a survey course in 2000, and later revised it
to add more interactive features and a computer opponent around 2001-2002.

Somewhat surprisingly it still works. The code is no longer _Ã  la mode_, if
ever it was, but for all the trash we talk about JavaScript, it's not common
for code written almost two decades ago to work out-of-the-box on a modern
platform without even superficial changes.
